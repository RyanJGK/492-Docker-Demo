# GitHub Pages 404 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Conflicting GitHub Actions Workflows**
**Problem:** Two workflows (`deploy-pages.yml` and `static.yml`) were both trying to deploy to GitHub Pages, causing deployment conflicts.

**Solution:** 
- Deleted `.github/workflows/static.yml`
- Kept only `deploy-pages.yml` which properly generates the static site using `generate_static.py`

### 2. **Branch Limitations**
**Problem:** The workflow only triggered on `main` and `master` branches, preventing testing from feature branches.

**Solution:**
- Updated `deploy-pages.yml` to include `cursor/**` branches
- Allows deployment testing from cursor agent branches

### 3. **JavaScript API Calls Failing**
**Problem:** The generated `docs/index.html` contained JavaScript that tried to POST to `/api/feedback`, which doesn't exist on GitHub Pages (static hosting only).

**Solution:**
- Modified `web/templates/dashboard.html` to support a `static_mode` flag
- When `static_mode=True`, the feedback buttons show an informational message instead of trying to submit
- Updated `generate_static.py` to pass `static_mode=True` when rendering the template

### 4. **Unclear User Experience**
**Problem:** Users visiting the GitHub Pages site didn't know it was a static demo with limited functionality.

**Solution:**
- Added "Static Demo" badge to the dashboard header
- Added an info banner explaining the limitations and how to run the full Docker version
- Modified feedback submission to show helpful message with Docker instructions

## Files Changed

1. `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` - Added cursor branch support
2. `.github/workflows/static.yml` - DELETED (conflicting workflow)
3. `web/templates/dashboard.html` - Added static_mode support and UI indicators
4. `generate_static.py` - Pass static_mode=True when rendering
5. `docs/index.html` - Regenerated with all fixes applied

## Testing Steps

1. **Verify Static Site Generation:**
   ```bash
   python3 generate_static.py
   ```
   Should successfully generate `docs/index.html`

2. **Check Generated File:**
   ```bash
   # Should show static demo banner
   grep "Static Demo Mode" docs/index.html
   
   # Should show modified submitFeedback function
   grep -A3 "function submitFeedback" docs/index.html
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Check Actions tab for successful deployment
   - Visit https://ryanjgk.github.io/492-Docker-Demo/
   - Verify page loads correctly
   - Click a feedback button to verify it shows the informational message

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### On GitHub Pages:
- ✅ Site loads without 404 errors
- ✅ Dashboard displays all 6 security alerts
- ✅ "Static Demo" badge visible in header
- ✅ Info banner explains it's read-only
- ✅ Clicking Approve/Reject shows helpful message
- ✅ All CSS/JS loads from CDN (no local dependencies)

### When Running Docker Version:
- ✅ No "Static Demo" indicators shown
- ✅ Feedback submission works normally
- ✅ POSTs to `/api/feedback` as expected
- ✅ Full functionality enabled

## Root Cause Analysis

The 404 errors were caused by:

1. **Workflow Conflicts:** Two competing workflows trying to deploy different content
2. **Static vs Dynamic Mismatch:** Template designed for dynamic Flask app being used for static GitHub Pages without modifications
3. **Missing Error Handling:** No graceful degradation when API endpoints unavailable

## Prevention for Future

1. Keep only ONE GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment
2. Always use the `static_mode` flag when generating static sites
3. Test generated static files locally before pushing
4. Keep template compatible with both static and dynamic deployments

## Deployment URL

## Additional Notes

- All external resources (Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons) load from CDN
- No local file dependencies that could cause 404s
- HTML is self-contained and portable
- Works offline after initial page load
