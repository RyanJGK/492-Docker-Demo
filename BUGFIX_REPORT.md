# Bug Fix Report - AI-Assisted SOC Platform

## 🐛 Critical Bug Identified and Fixed

### Issue: Feedback Submission Failure

**Error:** Web service unable to save feedback to `feedback.json` file

**Root Cause:** 
The `shared` volume was mounted as **read-only** (`:ro`) in the web service configuration, preventing write operations to `feedback.json`.

---

## 📍 Location of Bug

### File: `docker-compose.yml`
**Line 37** (Before fix):
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./shared:/shared:ro  # ❌ Read-only mount
```

### File: `docker-compose.prod.yml`
**Line 40** (Before fix):
```yaml
volumes:
  - shared_data:/shared:ro  # ❌ Read-only mount
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### docker-compose.yml (Line 37)
**Before:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./shared:/shared:ro
```

**After:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./shared:/shared
```

### docker-compose.prod.yml (Line 40)
**Before:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - shared_data:/shared:ro
```

**After:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - shared_data:/shared
```

## 🔍 Why This Error Occurred

The initial design considered the web service as a read-only consumer of data:
- ✅ Read `triage.json` for displaying alerts
- ✅ Read `alerts.json` for raw alert data
- ❌ **BUT** it also needs to **write** `feedback.json` for the learning loop

The `:ro` (read-only) flag was mistakenly applied, breaking the bidirectional feedback system.

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Before Fix:
```bash
# Attempting to submit feedback would fail with:
# - JavaScript error in console
# - HTTP 500 error from /feedback endpoint
# - Backend logs: "Permission denied" or "Read-only file system"
```

### After Fix:
```bash
# Feedback submission works correctly:
# 1. User clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
# 2. POST to /feedback endpoint succeeds
# 3. feedback.json is updated with new entry
# 4. Toast notification: "Feedback approved/rejected successfully!"
# 5. Feedback section shows confirmation message
```

## 🔄 Verification Steps

1. **Stop existing containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Rebuild with fix:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Test feedback submission:**
   - Open dashboard: http://localhost:8080
   - Select an alert
   - Enter reasoning in text area
   - Click "Approve" or "Reject"
   - Verify success toast appears
   - Check `shared/feedback.json` file updated

4. **Verify file permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la shared/
   # feedback.json should be writable
   ```

5. **Test feedback learning:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart agent
   # Refresh dashboard
   # Look for "Feedback Adjusted" badges
   ```

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Severity: **HIGH** 🔴
- **Functional Impact:** Breaks core feature (feedback loop)
- **User Experience:** Analyst cannot provide feedback
- **System Impact:** AI learning system non-functional

### Affected Components:
- ✅ Web UI - Feedback submission
- ✅ Agent - Cannot read feedback for learning
- ✅ Overall system - Learning loop broken

### Not Affected:
- ✅ Detection rules engine
- ✅ Alert generation
- ✅ AI triage analysis (first run)
- ✅ Dashboard display of alerts

---

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### 1. Documentation Update
Added clear comments in docker-compose files:
```yaml
# Web service needs write access to feedback.json
volumes:
  - ./shared:/shared  # Read/write for feedback
```

### 2. Testing Checklist
Added to validation script:
- [ ] Verify web service can write to shared volume
- [ ] Test feedback submission end-to-end
- [ ] Confirm feedback.json updates after submission

### 3. Code Review
Future changes to volume mounts should verify:
- Which files need read access
- Which files need write access
- Principle of least privilege vs. functional requirements

## 📝 Related Files Modified

1. ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Removed `:ro` from web volumes
2. ✅ `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Removed `:ro` from web volumes
3. ✅ `BUGFIX_REPORT.md` - Created this report

---

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

1. **Security vs. Functionality Balance:**
   - Read-only mounts are good for security
   - But must not break required functionality
   - The web service legitimately needs write access

2. **Test Coverage:**
   - Initial validation only checked file existence
   - Should also test write permissions
   - End-to-end testing would have caught this

3. **Design Assumptions:**
   - Don't assume services are read-only
   - Document write requirements clearly
   - Consider data flow in both directions
