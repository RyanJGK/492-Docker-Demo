# Fix: "Failed to Load Alerts" Error

## üêõ Issue Description

Users were experiencing a "Failed to load alerts" error when accessing the dashboard at http://localhost:8080 immediately after starting the platform with `docker-compose up`.

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **service orchestration timing problem**:

### The Problem:
1. **Rules service** runs once, creates `alerts.json`, then **exits** (takes ~5-10 seconds)
2. **Agent service** waits for alerts, calls OpenRouter API, creates `triage.json`, then **exits** (takes ~30-60 seconds)
3. **Web service** starts and immediately tries to read `triage.json`
4. Docker `depends_on` only waits for containers to **START**, not **COMPLETE**
5. Web service timeout was only **10 seconds** (5 retries √ó 2s)

### The Flow:
```
T+0s:   User runs docker-compose up
T+2s:   Rules container starts
T+3s:   Rules processing...
T+8s:   Rules completes ‚Üí alerts.json created ‚Üí container EXITS
T+9s:   Agent container starts (depends_on: rules)
T+10s:  Agent processing alerts...
T+15s:  Agent calls OpenRouter API (slow!)
T+45s:  Agent completes ‚Üí triage.json created ‚Üí container EXITS
T+10s:  Web container starts (depends_on: agent)
T+11s:  Web tries to load triage.json
T+21s:  ‚ùå Web timeout (10s) - file not ready yet!
```

**Result:** User sees "Failed to load alerts" because `triage.json` doesn't exist yet!

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Increased Web Service Timeout

**File:** `web/app.py`  
**Change:** Increased retry timeout from 10s to 60s

```python
# BEFORE (OLD)
max_retries = 5   # 5 √ó 2s = 10 second timeout
retry_count = 0

# AFTER (NEW)
max_retries = 30  # 30 √ó 2s = 60 second timeout
retry_count = 0
```

**Impact:** Web service now waits up to 60 seconds for data files

---

### Fix 2: Added File Size Validation

**File:** `web/app.py`  
**Change:** Check if files are empty before trying to parse

```python
# Check if file is empty or still being written
file_size = os.path.getsize(filepath)
if file_size == 0:
    logger.warning(f"File is empty: {filepath}")
    return default if default is not None else []
```

**Impact:** Prevents JSON parse errors on partially written files

---

### Fix 3: Created Startup Entrypoint Script

**File:** `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` (NEW)  
**Purpose:** Waits for data pipeline to complete before starting Flask

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Wait up to 120 seconds for alerts.json and triage.json
# Provides helpful diagnostic messages
# Initializes feedback.json if missing
# Then starts Flask app
```

**Impact:** Web service waits for data files before starting HTTP server

---

### Fix 4: Added Health Checks

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`  
**Change:** Added health check to web service

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 90s  # Give 90s for initial startup
```

**Impact:** Docker knows when web service is truly ready

---

### Fix 5: Better Logging and Diagnostics

**Files:** `web/app.py`, `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`  
**Change:** Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

```python
logger.info(f"Successfully loaded {filepath} ({file_size} bytes)")
logger.warning(f"File not found after {max_retries * 2} seconds: {filepath}")
```

**Impact:** Easier to diagnose issues in logs

---

### Fix 6: Created Diagnostic Script

**File:** `scripts/diagnose.sh` (NEW)  
**Purpose:** Automated diagnostics for users

```bash
bash scripts/diagnose.sh

# Checks:
# - Service status
# - File existence and sizes
# - Environment variables
# - API key configuration
# - Service logs
# - Web accessibility
```

**Impact:** Users can quickly identify issues

---

### Fix 7: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

**File:** `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (NEW)  
**Content:** Complete guide covering:
- Common issues and solutions
- Diagnostic commands
- Expected timing
- Log message explanations
- Quick fixes

**Impact:** Self-service support for users

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Fresh Start
```bash
# Clean everything
docker-compose down -v
rm -f shared/*.json

# Start fresh
docker-compose up --build

# Wait 60 seconds
# Access: http://localhost:8080
# Expected: Alerts display successfully
```

### Test 2: Watch Logs
```bash
docker-compose up --build

# In another terminal:
docker-compose logs -f web

# You should see:
# "Waiting for alerts.json..."
# "‚úì alerts.json found"
# "Waiting for triage.json..."
# "‚úì triage.json found"
# "Starting Flask web application..."
```

### Test 3: Verify Files
```bash
# After 60 seconds
ls -lh shared/

# Should show:
# alerts.json  (~1-2 KB)
# triage.json  (~5-10 KB)
# feedback.json (empty array)
```

### Test 4: API Endpoints
```bash
# Test health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}

# Test alerts
curl http://localhost:8080/api/alerts
# Returns: {"status":"success","count":15,"alerts":[...]}
```
